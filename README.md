# Testeger

## Project Description

This repository contains the source code for Testeger, a platform dedicated to the management of software validations and testing. The project is developed as part of the Final Year Project at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná (PUCPR).

## Team

- **Students**: Lucas Eskudlark and Fernando Dias
- **Advisor**: Rosilene Fernandes

## Context

The aim of this project is to develop the Testeger platform, which seeks to centralize and optimize all stages of the manual testing process. Through it, it will be possible to:

- Create projects with members in different roles (Project Manager, QA, Developer)
- Create test requests
- Create test cases
- Schedule tests
- Time tests
- Record evidence
- Register the status of requests and test cases
- Request corrections
- Track metrics of the entire testing process (test requests, test cases, team, and individual metrics)

## Objective

The objective of Testeger is to create a collaborative ecosystem that significantly improves the efficiency and quality of communication between developers and quality assurance professionals. The project promotes a culture of continuous improvement and excellence throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Key Features

1. **Project Management**: Allows the creation and management of a project on the platform, adding members to collaborate in the process.
2. **Test Request Management**: Allows the creation, tracking, and editing of test requests.
3. **Test Case Creation**: Allows the creation and detailed definition of test cases necessary for each test request.
4. **Test Scheduling**: Allows scheduling of tests for registered requests in the calendar, ensuring an efficient workflow.
5. **Evidence Recording**: Allows storing of proofs and documentation of the conducted tests, indicating the status and results obtained.
6. **Status of Requests/Test Cases**: Monitors and updates the progress of each test request and test case in real-time.
7. **Request for Corrections**: Identifies and communicates the need for adjustments and corrections in a test request.
8. **Rework Metrics Generation**: Analyzes and provides data on the work generated during the testing process, aiding in continuous improvement.
